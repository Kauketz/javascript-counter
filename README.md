Hello!

This is my very first project.
I followed the tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org (GOAT) at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=1825s

As this is my very first javascipt project, I had no idea where to begin and how.
Beginner tutorials like these help me learn little by little while following along more experienced developers.

This note is for myself, to remind me where I began. Hopefully, in a while I will come back and see how far I have come!

Good job and good luck future me!
